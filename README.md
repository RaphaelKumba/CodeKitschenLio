# The Mulenga Project

Simple Website for a project for my brother.
My brother is starting a non-profit organisation with a freind from Afrika. They are building a farm to produce food for the neighborhood.
As the project is becomming reality, he would like to have a simple Website to display the progress made at the farm and to keep the donors uptodate.

The website will consist of one main homepage and include some photos and some youtube videos. There will be a formular or link for new donors.
